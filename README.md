Have you ever seen a drawing robot? Probably. But have you seen one that can draw upon your direct request on what to draw? TsunComp does exactly that.
The pipeline we developed is a fully automated speech to machine code process, that uses GPT3.5 and StableDiffusion at its core.
It sends out the data to a nicely designed plotter that then draws the generated image for you using a pen, which results in a physical memory that you can hold on to. Everything fully automated.
